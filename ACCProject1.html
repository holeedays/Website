                Click to swap between sketches! The prompt was to make "interactive typography"
                where users can interact with a specific word and have it react some way
                in the way that is uniquely characteristic to it. The first 3 sketches are my finalized 
                works while the remaining 9 sketches (non interactable) were my prototypes leading to the final build.
