            I'm currently studying at <a href = "https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/"> Parsons </a> (class of '27), 
            majoring in the game design pathway of Design and Technology (BFA).
            <br>
            I like to code (still a novice) and draw digitally in my freetime so <b> HMU </b> if you need some commissions 
            or some help with coding!

                I hope you have a good time checking it out
