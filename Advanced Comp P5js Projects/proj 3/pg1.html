            The debate of nature versus nurture over shaping our behavioral and cognitive development has been disputed about
            for over 2 centuries ago. Over the years and according to contemporary beliefs, it's not black and white,
            external or internal factors that determine the people we become. Rather, it's a complex interplay of the two.
            This quiz explores the "nurture" side of things, delving into a variety of questions centered around common topics
            like financial standing, race, physical health, and political orientation. From these choices, you can determine
            how the world may be responsible for certain traits we exhibit.
