I decided to go the same path as the example put on the project so I opted for a really simple face design; the faces I sketched at the very beginning were just smiley faces of different scales with triangular noses and some eyebrows for good measure. Despite the simple face sketches I made, I quickly realized that translating them into code was a whole different beast. As you can tell, the face at its most minimal scale doesn't look even remotely close to the sketch I made: it's like 3 lines versus an actual face. Throughout the whole coding process, I had to make a lot of compromises with the ideas in my sketch and in my head with the capabilities of the functions I was given. Thankfully, I was able to get the overall form and layout right by the end of it - even if it wasn't the closest thing in the world.
