Welcome to shooter! The game where you shoot your inner demons in the hopes of surviving another day

This game was an entirely different concept compared to my original concept, which was to make a 2d platformer game. Due to a lot of issues with physics logic and whatnot, I ended up switching to this shooter game that we see now.

Though the gameplay had changed, the theme was still the same: it's me battlng and fighting through the pitfalls of life. The enemies are a representation of my 'inner demons' that culminate when life gets tough (the specific time frame of this is starting post senior yr to college time) and so I have to beat them to protect myself. 

I've attached the original text file describing the concept of my platformer game as well as these initial storyboards. 

Despite the swap from a very robust (platformer) to a semi-robust game (shooter), there was still a lot of coding done. In the beginning, I wrote a lot of code that was really redundant: this caused significant issues with hit detection and a number of things in the game. After some help a lengthy time dedicated to refactoring, I was able to make a shooter game that handled actually pretty well. My primary focus throughout the project was to make the game 100% playable and working rather than on the actual design/aesthetic of the project: this can probably be seen given the lack of really anything in my game. Even then, I still have some gripes about the mechanics of the game. Regardless, I feel like I really learned a lot about making a pretty decent shooter and coding more efficiently. And I ended up with a neat little project too.
