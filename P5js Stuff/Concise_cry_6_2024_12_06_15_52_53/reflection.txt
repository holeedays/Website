  My data portrait is pretty self explanatory: It's the number of times I've peed over the span of 7 days (Oct. 4 - Oct. 10). The graph can be read like almost any other conventional XY graph, but be warned that the points do not necessarily align with the notches on y axis: there's a small offset that grows progressively larger due to some error with the code. You're better off coutning the circles instead. You can also click the dates to hide or show the data points if you'd like.
  My design process was pretty simple: I selected a relatively simple habit and kept track of it within a number of days. Next was to just input the values into an array so I could use the data and make it more visual in p5js. For the visual aspect of the data, I decided to opt for a more conventional method of statistical representation: the good ol' xy graph.
  Since the visualizations only involved some flashy animations, I didn't have that much difficulty coding nor did I struggle representing my data accurately. However, I did approach some problems when it came to animating the actual data points: probably due to the amount of if statements and some lag in frame rate, the points don't actually align exactly with the notches on the y axis. I'm also not proud of having over 600 lines of code thanks to the function DataPoints(). I'm pretty sure there's a neater and less chunky way to write the same code, but it's whatever.
  Over the process of recording this data, I learned that I pee way more than the average person. I kind of knew this beforehand, but it's great having a visual representaiton of this.
