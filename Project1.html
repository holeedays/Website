                    This was the first project I have ever did utilizing p5js. The concept was to use 2d primitives to make an item 
                    <br>
                    specified by the partner we were paired up with. I ended up having to make a key that involved not only 2d
                    <br>
                    primitives but a custom script from the p5js library (the smooth gradient) and the use of bezier curves.
