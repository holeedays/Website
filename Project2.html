                    This was my second project utilizing p5js. The prompt was to make a random face generator.
                    The faces generated were supposed to be random but also should've scaled or were to be
                    somewhat altered based on user interaction and input. I made a face that varied in 
                    size (facial features included) at a random range based on where the user's 
                    mouse position was. I also included the ability to change the face to a 
                    random color when the mouse was pressed.
