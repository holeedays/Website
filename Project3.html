                    Experimental clocks was my third p5js project. Like the assignment name suggests, I had
                    to make a clock that could tell time in an unconventional sense: hence the keyword 
                    "experimental". My clock told time more conventionally but it had a twist to it:
                    The top clock tells the actual world time and the bottom clock tells the 
                    procastination time. Every 10 minutes, a pop up asking if you'd like 
                    to procastinate for 10 mins or not, will pop up. Everytime you click
                    "procrastinate", the procastinationation clock will start running. 
                    It's a weird juxtaposition of a clock telling you how much time 
                    you wasted procastinating in relation to the actual time.
