                    Calling back to the first assignment. My fourth assignment, exquisite corpse involved using only 2d primitives
                    <br> 
                    with the incorporation of functions into the mix. The prompt was to share drawings of a charcter with 3 other
                    <br> 
                    people. Then, in the spirit of exquisite corpse, we would take one section of each other's character to
                    <br>
                    make our exquisite corpse. I ended up getting the head of a king, the body of an alien, and the legs
                    <br>
                    of an anthropomorphic dog.
