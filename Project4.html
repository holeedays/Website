                    Calling back to the first assignment. My fourth assignment, exquisite corpse involved using only 2d primitives
                    with the incorporation of functions into the mix. The prompt was to share drawings of a charcter with 3 other
                    people. Then, in the spirit of exquisite corpse, we would take one section of each other's character to
                    make our exquisite corpse. I ended up getting the head of a king, the body of an alien, and the legs
                    of an anthropomorphic dog.
