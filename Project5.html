                    The fifth assignment involved making any sort of animated optical illusion. I opted to make
                    a simpler optical illusion, the ebbinghaus illusion, but with a more interactive base. 
                    <br>
                    Essentially, I made a game out of the illusion. There are two circles surrounded by a 
                    ring of other circles. Your goal is to discern whether the two circles are actually
                    <br>
                    the same size or they are slightly different. Just saying, the game is really 
                    difficult so I wish you luck if you want to try it out!
