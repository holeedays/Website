                    The fifth assignment involved making any sort of animated optical illusion. I opted to make
                    a simpler optical illusion, the ebbinghaus illusion, but with a more interactive base. 
                    Essentially, I made a game out of the illusion. There are two circles surrounded by a 
                    ring of other circles. Your goal is to discern whether the two circles are actually
                    the same size or they are slightly different. Just saying, the game is really 
                    difficult so I wish you luck if you want to try it out!
