                    My 6th assignment was less coding involved than most of the other assignments. The prompt was
                    to record any habit of ours for roughly a week and then visually demonstrate this data in
                    any manner you find fits. The data I used is pretty self explanatory. I decided to stick
                    with a conventional line graph for visualization but it would be animated: similar to 
                    the infrographics one sees in the internet. To actually see the data points, click
                    the dates: make sure to hover over the date until you see that it is underlined
                    then you can click it. You can also click the date again to remove the data points.
