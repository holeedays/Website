                    The final assignment and 7th assignment, autobiographical game, is a culmination of all our projects.
                    Unlike the other assignments, this assignment's prompt was completely open ended: it just had to
                    involve some sort of autobiographical element (it could be very cursory, like in my game). My 
                    autobiographical game, titled with the very original name 'Shooter', is a 2d shooter 
                    reminiscent of antiquated games like Space Invaders and Asteroids. It has 3 levels, 
                    fully functional title and reset buttons, an end/title screen, SFX, and UI elements.
                    To play, use WASD, arrow keys to move and RMB (mouse) to shoot. Enjoy!
